<p>
Constructor should not have too many parameters: 
    having many parameters is an indication that it does more than one thing and/or that too much is done in the constructor

    From Clean Code:
    The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero (niladic). Next comes one (monadic), followed closely by two (dyadic). Three arguments (triadic) should be avoided where possible. More than three (polyadic) requires very special justification -- and then shouldn't be used anyway.
