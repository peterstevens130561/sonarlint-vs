Condition compilation is really an anti-pattern.</p>
    <dl>
        <li><
It's nearly impossible to test in a meaningful way because the code depends on the environment
        </li>
        <li>
It's very dangerous to make edits because you have to test your change under so many different conditions
            </li>
        <li>
It's hard to read the code because you have to know the value of many external factors
                </li>
        <li>
The combinatorial complexity of all these flags makes a large number of configurations that have to be reasoned about
            </li>
        <li>
You have to recompile a large amount of code to see if you broke anything
            </li>
